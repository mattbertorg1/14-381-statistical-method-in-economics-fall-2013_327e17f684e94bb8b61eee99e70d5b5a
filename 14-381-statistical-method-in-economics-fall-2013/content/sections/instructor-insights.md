Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _14.381 Statistical Method in Economics_ as it was taught by Prof. Anna Mikusheva in Fall 2013.

_Statistical Method in Economics_ is part of the Economics Department’s sequence on Statistics and Econometrics. It provides an introduction to probability and statistics as background for advanced econometrics and introduction to the linear regression model. 14.381 highlights illustrations from economics and the application of these concepts to economic problems.

**Note**: 14.381 is divided into two sections and is co-taught by Prof. Mikusheva and another instructor. The Fall 2013 version of 14.381 on OCW focuses on the first part of the course. See the [2006 offering of 14.381](/courses/14-381-statistical-method-in-economics-fall-2006/) to learn about the second part of the course.

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 35% Midterm
- 15% Problem sets. For each of 6 problem sets, students only needed to hand in one solution to the TA. The other problems in the sets were for the students own study.
- The rest of the grade for the course was completed during the second half of the class (35% final exam, 15% problem sets).
